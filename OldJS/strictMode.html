    <p>
        Strict Mode  allows you to place a program,
         or a function, in a “strict” operating context.
         Strict mode makes several changes to JavaScript semantics. It eliminates silent errors and instead throws them so that the code won't run with errors in the code. 
         It will also point out mistakes that prevent JavaScript engines from doing optimizations.
